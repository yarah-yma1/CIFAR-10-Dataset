# Implementation
- The models implementation consists of an input of the MNIST dataset in which it involves a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), with each image being 28x28 pixels. The model is trained using 25 EPOCHs in which it is passed through 25 times, with a validation split of 0.2 to prevent overfitting and validates on a specific portion of the data. 
# Requirments 
- This project requires tensorflow, keras, and scikit-learn. It was developed using a Python environment through VSCode.
- Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the following dependencies:
```
tensorflow
numpy
```
# How to Use
- To run this code, you will need to have a Python environment installed on your computer. You can download "cifar_10_dataset.py" into a folder, and open the folder within VS Code.
- The CIFAR-10 dataset is automatically downloaded and loaded in the script, so no external dataset is required.

# Error Handling 
- This project does not have any error handling.
